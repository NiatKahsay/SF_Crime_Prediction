# SF Crime Prediction Project

## **Overview**
This project aims to predict crime patterns in San Francisco using historical crime data. By leveraging machine learning models, we strive to provide insights that can help improve safety measures, optimize law enforcement resource allocation, and proactively identify potential crime hotspots.

## **Objectives**
1. Build predictive models to anticipate the location and type of crimes.
2. Analyze historical data to identify crime trends and patterns.
3. Provide actionable insights for better decision-making in crime prevention.

## **Dataset**
